// another way to validate the guess would be to wrap it in a struct like this

pub struct Guess {
    value: i32,
}

impl Guess {
    pub fn new(value: i32) -> Guess {
        if value < 1 || value > 100 {
            panic!("Guess value must be between 1 and 100, got {}.", value);
        }
        Guess { value }
    }

    pub fn value(&self) -> i32 {
        self.value
    }
}

// a function can safely take or return Guess rather than i32 with no need to do any validation in its body
// because the only way to create a Guess it through the 'new' function, which already validates the input
